  ## Basics

1. Proper authenticated login.

2. In the navigation panel, the user can see links to:

* Car items that you selected as a theme.

- Copy the project URL as displayed on HTTPS tab

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
   
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
   
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
   
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.

### Usage 

- Make sure you have npm and node installed.

- I recommend the use of VS code as a code editor, but you can use any code editor.

- Run in your terminal `npm run start` to see the run the app in your default browser.

- You should see the rockets page as the page loads.
